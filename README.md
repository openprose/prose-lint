# openprose-lint

Deterministic linter for [OpenProse](https://github.com/openprose/prose) programs — a Markdown-based language for multi-agent orchestration. A fast, compiled counterweight to the agent-native execution model: it checks the static, spec-driven parts of the language that should stay deterministic even when execution is delegated to an LLM.

## Quick start

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # fetch the vendored spec (required)
cargo run -- lint path/to/program.md      # lint one program (or pass a directory)
```

Each file reports `ok` or its diagnostics, then a profile summary. Diagnostics
print as `file:line:col severity CODE message`:

```text
my-program.md:11:1 warning MDW011 Ensures clause uses hedging language (should/might/may); ensures are obligations, not suggestions

profile: compat
0 error(s), 1 warning(s) across 1 file(s)
```

Errors fail the run (exit 1); warnings do not. Build details are below; see
[Lint Rules](#lint-rules) and [Exit Codes](#exit-codes) for the code families.

## Build

The OpenProse spec is vendored as a git submodule, so initialize submodules first:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo build
```

The crate is not published to crates.io (`publish = false`). After `cargo build`, the
binary is at `${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-target}/debug/openprose-lint`; the examples below
write `openprose-lint` as shorthand. To run a subcommand without installing it on
your `PATH`, prefer `cargo run -- <subcommand>` (e.g. `cargo run -- lint
path/to/program.md`).

## Commands

```bash

```

The public linting surface is intentionally small: `lint` for current Markdown programs and
`lint-legacy` for archived imperative programs. Version- or generation-suffixed command names are
not part of the public interface.

### Preflight Briefing

The `briefing` command outputs a versioned, structured markdown block designed to be read by a Prose-Complete VM agent before execution. It contains pre-parsed contract, service resolution, feature flags, and diagnostic summary — putting the agent in compiler headspace with deterministic structural analysis.

## Reference Spec

The linter vendors `openprose/prose` as a git submodule:

- submodule: `reference/openprose-prose`
- VM spec: `reference/openprose-prose/skills/open-prose/prose.md`
- Forme spec: `reference/openprose-prose/skills/open-prose/forme.md`
- Deps spec: `reference/openprose-prose/skills/open-prose/deps.md`
- pin: see `specs/openprose.json`

Build-time vocabulary extraction reads the legacy v0 compiler spec at `reference/openprose-prose/skills/open-prose/v0/compiler.md` during `cargo build` and generates `spec_vocab.rs`. Bump the submodule to update: `cd reference/openprose-prose && git fetch origin && git checkout origin/main && cd ../..`

### Spec Identity

`openprose-lint specs verify` checks a spec identity manifest without relying on
package version alone. The manifest records:

- the OpenProse spec id and source repo,
- the OpenProse skill version and `runtime_contract`,
- optional package provenance such as `@openprose/reactor` versions,
- SHA-256 digests for the load-bearing skill/spec files.

Package versions are labels; artifact hashes and the pinned git checkout are the
contract. Direct manifest mode works for package bundles, scratch checkouts, and
release candidates:

```bash
openprose-lint specs verify --manifest skill/open-prose/spec-version.json \
  --root skill/open-prose \
  --expect-repo openprose/prose \
  --package-json package.json
```

If a manifest declares package versions, pass matching `--package-json` paths for
each declared package. Otherwise verification fails rather than treating package
provenance as implicitly checked.

For git-pinned source checks, pass the checkout, expected repo, and expected
commit explicitly:

```bash
openprose-lint specs verify --manifest skills/open-prose/spec-version.json \
  --root skills/open-prose \
  --git-repo . \
  --expect-repo openprose/prose \
  --expect-commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

When a spec registry entry declares `paths.version_manifest`, `--spec` mode uses
that registry repo and pin as the expected source identity:

```bash
openprose-lint specs verify --spec openprose
```

The manifest may omit `source.commit` when it is committed inside the same git
tree; the external pin from `--expect-commit` or `specs/openprose.json` avoids a
self-referential commit hash. Packaged bundles may include `source.commit`
because the package is assembled after the source commit exists.

When `--git-repo` is supplied, `--root` must live inside that checkout. The
verifier also reads `SKILL.md` frontmatter and checks that its `version` and
`runtime_contract` match the manifest. Git-pinned checks compare each artifact
digest to the blob stored at the expected commit, so uncommitted worktree bytes
cannot masquerade as pinned source. Unknown future `runtime_contract` values
fail closed until this linter is updated, and artifact paths must resolve to
regular files without symlinked components under the declared root.

## Profiles

- `compat` (default): accepts current syntax plus known historical corpus patterns
- `strict`: also flags spec deviations that `compat` tolerates, such as missing frontmatter `version` fields. Warnings do not fail the run.

```bash
openprose-lint lint --profile strict path/to/program.md
```

### Legacy compatibility

OpenProse previously used an imperative `.prose` format. Most new users should ignore it, but archived programs can still be checked explicitly. Do not document or depend on private generation-suffixed aliases; use the public commands below.

```bash
openprose-lint lint-legacy path/to/file.prose
```

## Exit Codes

- `0`: no lint errors
- `1`: one or more lint errors
- `2`: CLI usage or filesystem error

Warnings do not fail the run.

## Lint Rules

Errors:

- `MDE001`–`MDE009`: structural (frontmatter delimiters)
- `MDE010`–`MDE019`: required frontmatter fields
- `MDE020`–`MDE029`: body structure
- `MDE030`–`MDE039`: component validation
- `MDE040`–`MDE049`: cross-validation (single-file)
- `MDE050`–`MDE059`: cross-validation (multi-file)

Warnings:

- `MDW001`–`MDW009`: frontmatter vocabulary
- `MDW010`–`MDW019`: contract quality
- `MDW020`–`MDW029`: component quality
- `MDW030`–`MDW039`: cross-validation warnings

## Architecture

The public `lint` command targets the current declarative Markdown language. A legacy path remains for archived imperative `.prose` programs:

- **Current Markdown linting**: parses `.md` programs, including heading classification, contract parsing (`## Contract` and bare labels), service resolution, and `use:` import awareness. This is exposed as `openprose-lint lint`.
- **Legacy compatibility linting**: parses archived `.prose` files. Vocabulary is extracted from the legacy v0 compiler spec at build time via `build.rs` -> `spec_vocab.rs`. This is exposed as `openprose-lint lint-legacy`.
- **Briefing generation**: reuses the current Markdown parser to produce structured preflight analysis for VM agents.
- **`capabilities.rs`**: infers runtime capability requirements from a program, emits implied substrate dependencies, and can compare them against a runtime manifest.
- **`adapter.rs`**: validates deterministic adapter manifests that pin exact OpenProse files, channels, and phase attachments.
- **`adapter_dogfood.rs`**: turns the pinned Claude Code adapter into a repeatable live proof run by rendering the exact prompts/files, staging a temp program copy, validating the root VM's final JSON proof payloads, checking reported published outputs on disk, surfacing observed hook/tool-use evidence, and verifying the expected published binding is actually present and non-empty.

## Editor support

- **LSP:** `cargo build` also produces an `openprose-lsp` language-server binary for editor diagnostics (live lint + hover).
- **WASM:** the linter library compiles to WebAssembly (`cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --lib`); `src/wasm.rs` exports `lint`/`hover` for embedding in external editors and tools. It has no in-repo consumer and `scripts/ci.sh` only compiles it, so treat it as a stable but lightly maintained integration surface.

## Development

Verification runs as a local gate, not GitHub Actions: `bash scripts/ci.sh` runs fmt, installs the pinned Bun tooling, runs `true-up gate` and a spec-hygiene check, then runs clippy, tests, build, and the conformance + lint smoke checks. Activate the pre-push hook with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
